**NoteCrafted** is a sleek and user-friendly note-taking application built using **React.js**. It allows users to easily create, edit, delete, and manage notes with a minimalistic interface. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills in React.js, showcasing responsive design and interactive user experience.

- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find notes with a built-in search feature.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Notes are saved locally so that users can access them even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the app.
